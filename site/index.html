          At Epilentio we engineer reliable and regression-free software solutions
          for your ideas.
        </h1>
        <p>
          It doesn't matter whether you need a production ready software solution,
          a rapidly developed software and/or hardware prototype, staff augmentation,
          or consultation throughout your project.

        At Epilentio, we leverage the strength of functional programming languages
        like OCaml, Haskell, and Rust to engineer robust and high-quality software.
        These languages enable us to eliminate the vast majority of bugs by design,
        thanks to features like a strong type system and immutability.
        <br>
        This approach not only results in more reliable software but also
        significantly boosts development speed by reducing debugging time
        and simplifies long-term maintenance.
        <br>
        With Nix/NixOS, we ensure deterministic and reproducible builds,
        enabling seamless deployment and system configuration management,
        and ultimately allowing us to provide reliable operations for our clients.
